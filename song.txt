My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radioâ€¦

And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Hero, baby)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like it yikky yeah, check it Travie, I can handle that
